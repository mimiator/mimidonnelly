      <h2>About:</h2>
<p><b>Scalable success starts with strategy. I build that.</b>
<br>From global launches to full-funnel marketing, I help brands grow smarter by translating complex challenges into clear, actionable strategies. My work connects platforms, teams, and timelines, all built for lasting impact.

<br><br>For more than ten years, I’ve led marketing programs from concept to execution across sectors, such as beauty, tech, and social impact. My work has engaged millions globally and delivered solutions built to scale.

<br><br>With a foundation in retention, CRM, and global communications, I create customer experiences that perform and resonate. I’ve owned go-to-market strategy, built multi-channel operational systems from the ground up, and scaled engagement for billion-dollar brands and fast-growing startups alike.

<br><br>I lead with vision and execute with precision. I bring clarity to chaos, turn momentum into results, and build systems that don’t just work—they win.
